Invaders from outer space have arrived and are abducting humans using tractor beams. Players must crack the codeword to stop the abduction!

It’s quite like that classic game, [“Hangman”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_%28game%29), but with a better premise. Plus, building this command-line game was the Codecademy 2019 Software Engineer Internship Backend Programming Challenge!
